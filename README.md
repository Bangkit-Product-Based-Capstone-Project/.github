## Explanation of FoodHunt
### Background Problem

The younger generation has a tendency to eat fast food from foreign franchises, which is bad for UMKM, which sells Indonesian food. Additionally, because foreign franchises have a budget for advertising, they can reach more people than UMKM. Our team wants to tackle this problem because we want to preserve Indonesian food. With this application, tourists and Indonesian people will not be confused and will know more about Indonesia's food diversity.

### Reason

One of our members came up with this idea when he realized that many Indonesian food businesses have fewer visitors than foreign food franchises. We also discussed how poorly our knowledge about Indonesian food is, especially among the younger generation.

### Intro of FoodHunt

Sometimes, when tourists visit an area in Indonesia, they want to buy certain food but don't know the name of the food because of the language barrier. Have you ever thought that there is an application that can only scan food to tell the food's name?

### Solution

We created FoodHunt, where tourist and younger generation can scan local food they found and get knowledge about the food and also can found local restaurant that sells the food.
